=============
 1. Overview
=============

    The php_queue example is a working example CloudPRNT server based on the PHP language hosted by a server.
    This demonstration implements a very simple queue management system,
    in which customers can press a button (displayed with web browser)
    to print a ticket with a queue number and optionally additional text and image data.

    This demonstration is intentionally basic, with no consideration for security,
    calling customers and other considerations that would be necessary for a real life deployment.

    For printing, all print jobs are created using the Star Document Markup language
    and converted to the correct printer supported format using the cputil utility.

    This allows support of all CloudPRNT compatible printers, regardless of command emulation or print width.

    Please refer to SDK documents for CloudPRNT / Star Document Markup language / cputil details.
